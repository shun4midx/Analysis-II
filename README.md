# Analysis-II
Some of Shun's (Real) Analysis II Notes during the Spring 2025 Semester and perhaps even some exercises he does.

I plan to upload my biweekly notes for Analysis II during Spring 2025, which will focus more on Integrals and Sequences and Series.

I like to take notes by hand using GoodNotes, because I find it most natural and pretty this way. Since it is my own preference, I would not upload a LaTeX file equivalent for my notes, it should be enjoyed as is.

I will only start uploading the week of Feb 17th.
