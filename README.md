# Shun's Analysis II Notes

## Notice, I may not upload summary notes as fast, since the semester is hitting me like a truck, but I will definitely still upload them. I'll upload normal notes on time though for sure.

Some of Shun's (Real) Analysis II Notes during the Spring 2025 Semester and perhaps even some exercises he does.

I plan to upload my biweekly notes for Analysis II during Spring 2025, which will focus more on Integrals and Sequences and Series.

I like to take notes by hand using GoodNotes, because I find it most natural and pretty this way. Since it is my own preference, I would not upload a LaTeX file equivalent for my notes, it should be enjoyed as is.

I will also create LaTeX files (and their PDFs) under the Summaries folder, it is just a compilation of all definitions and theorems over the course of all the notes I upload. I do not consider them my notes though, although they technically are my notes too. In fact, they are literally just copies of my notes. The files `theorems.tex` and `theorems.pdf` contain lemmas, propositions, remarks, and corollaries too, not just theorems.

Note, for the theorems document, I'll write down all the theorem statements for sure, but I won't necessarily write the proof outlines for all proofs.
